            <p>I am currently a senior at Hunter College. At this point in time, I have taken a few media classes and my experience in these classes can be described with more than one word. Intrigued, overwhelmed, confused, struggling, and a little bit of happiness are the few words I would use to describe how I've felt thus far. I wasn't quite prepared for what media studies had in store but I eventually found out as I started taking classes. Most media professors have been helpful in terms of answering questions and helping me with the classwork or any homework's. However, as I progressed in the emerging media concentration, a particular class & professor made me realize that I didn't want to be in this concentration anymore. I didn't enjoy production classes as much as I thought I did and I wanted more freedom to explore into the other concentrations and to take non-production classes. This lead me to change my concentration to general media and allowed me to have more breathing room.  

                The end goal is to become an event planner. Hunter didn't really have any thing as close to this goal yet the closest thing was media studies. As I learned about this major I realized that even event planners use social media to promote their brand. I knew that somehow I could make it work and still am hoping that it does. However, I wouldn't mind working as a social media promoter, in marketing, or anything along the lines of that. I know that a lot businesses have been affected because of COVID-19 and it will take time for them to get back to normality, but I hope one day soon I am able to find some kind of internship or job to help me get my foot into the industry. </p>
