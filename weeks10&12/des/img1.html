            <p>For this project, I had watched and followed a tutorial on youtube. I remember wanting to challenge myself. While following the video, I remember I had became frustrated and started the project over a couple times. But in the end it was re warding because I had been successful in following the video. For this montage I used the masking tool. In order to make this effect I used a photo of a bulb and then I removed its inner parts. After that I added water, splash and the fishes. I used the masking and blending modes to match everything to the best of my ability.  </p>
