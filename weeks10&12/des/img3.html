            <p>For this assignment, the goal was to use shapes to create an eye that showed some kind of emotion. I chose to make an eye that had tears falling down. I wanted the color of the eye to be blue. I also wanted it to look like a real human eye and to achieve that I kept my shapes simple and added an eyebrow. </p>
