            <p>For this project, the goal was to use the skills we had learned to recreate any image of our choosing and make it animated. I had used an image of myself standing in front of the Vessel. While doing this project, I remember thinking that it was very tedious to recreate because I had to first outline everything and then go in and fill in each shape with the appropriate color. I feel as though I did a sloppy job, but I still think I did my best.</p>
