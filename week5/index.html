					It was a warm sunny day, I went to visit a friend at Queens College. I was waiting for her to get out of class. She was taking an exam and I got hungry while waiting for her, so I decided to look around for something to eat. I went to the cafeteria and found customizable halal food for $4, which includes adding extra toppings
					like beans or different kinds of rice. I have been addicted to that place ever since.

					I was waiting for the bus one day when I bumped into a old friend from highschool. I hadn't seen her in forever
					and turns out we both had class that day so we were going to take the same bus. We had the whole bus ride to catch up and had a nice conversation about our majors and life in general. When we reached campus we talked about meeting up some time during the semester and we checked our schedules to see what time would both suit us. Turns out we never managed to hang out.
